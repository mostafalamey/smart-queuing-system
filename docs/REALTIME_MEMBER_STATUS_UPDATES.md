# Realtime Member Status Updates Implementation

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive realtime updates for the member management system using Supabase realtime subscriptions. This ensures that:

1. **Member Status Changes**: When an admin deactivates/reactivates a member, the change is immediately reflected in the UI
2. **Automatic Signout**: Deactivated members are immediately signed out without requiring page refresh
3. **Live Table Updates**: All member management tables update instantly when member data changes

## Features Implemented

### 🔄 **Automatic Member Signout on Deactivation**

**File**: `admin/src/hooks/useMemberStatusMonitor.ts`

**Purpose**: Monitors the current user's member status and automatically signs them out if deactivated by an admin.

**Key Features**:

- Subscribes to realtime changes on the `members` table
- Filters changes for the current authenticated user
- Automatically triggers signout when `is_active` becomes `false`
- Shows toast notification before signing out
- Handles cleanup on component unmount

**Implementation**:

```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel("member-status-monitor")
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    {
      event: "UPDATE",
      schema: "public",
      table: "members",
      filter: `auth_user_id=eq.${authUserId}`,
    },
    (payload) => {
      if (!payload.new.is_active) {
        showWarning("Your account has been deactivated by an administrator.");
        setTimeout(() => signOut(), 2000);
      }
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### 📊 **Live Member Table Updates**

**File**: `admin/src/app/organization/features/shared/useOrganizationData.ts`

**Purpose**: Real-time updates for the main members list in the organization dashboard.

**Features**:

- Subscribes to all changes (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on members table
- Filters by organization ID for tenant isolation
- Automatically parses PostgreSQL array format for `department_ids`
- Updates the members state without requiring page refresh

**Implementation**:

```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel("members-realtime")
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    {
      event: "*",
      schema: "public",
      table: "members",
      filter: `organization_id=eq.${userProfile.organization_id}`,
    },
    (payload) => {
      if (payload.eventType === "INSERT") {
        // Add new member
      } else if (payload.eventType === "UPDATE") {
        // Update existing member
      } else if (payload.eventType === "DELETE") {
        // Remove deleted member
      }
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### 🚫 **Deactivated Members Real-time Updates**

**Files**:

- `admin/src/app/organization/features/member-management/MemberManagement.tsx`
- `admin/src/app/organization/features/inactive-members/DeactivatedMembers.tsx`

**Purpose**: Real-time updates for deactivated members sections.

**Features**:

- Tracks deactivated members (`is_active=false`)
- Automatically moves members between active/deactivated lists
- Handles permanent deletions
- Updates member information changes

**Key Logic**:

```typescript
if (updatedMember.is_active) {
  // Member was reactivated, remove from deactivated list
  setDeactivatedMembers((prev) =>
    prev.filter((m) => m.id !== updatedMember.id)
  );
} else {
  // Member info updated while still deactivated
  setDeactivatedMembers((prev) =>
    prev.map((m) => (m.id === updatedMember.id ? updatedMember : m))
  );
}
```

## Integration with Authentication System

### 🔐 **AuthContext Integration**

**File**: `admin/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

The member status monitor is automatically activated for all authenticated users:

```typescript
// Member status monitoring for auto-signout
useMemberStatusMonitor(user?.id || null, signOut, showWarning);
```

**Benefits**:

- No additional setup required in components
- Automatic activation/deactivation with auth state
- Centralized signout handling
- Consistent user experience across the app

## Database Requirements

### 📋 **Supabase Realtime Setup**

The implementation requires realtime to be enabled on the `members` table:

```sql
-- Enable realtime for members table
ALTER publication supabase_realtime ADD TABLE members;
```

### 🔒 **Row Level Security (RLS)**

RLS policies ensure users only receive updates for their organization:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for realtime
CREATE POLICY "Users can subscribe to own org members"
ON members FOR SELECT
USING (organization_id = (
  SELECT organization_id
  FROM members
  WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
));
```

## User Experience

### ⚡ **Immediate Updates**

- **Admin Action**: Admin deactivates a member
- **Result**: Member is immediately signed out (2-second delay for notification)
- **Visibility**: Member disappears from active members list instantly
- **Notification**: Clear toast message explaining the action

### 🔄 **Bidirectional Updates**

- **Deactivation**: Active member moves to deactivated list
- **Reactivation**: Deactivated member moves to active list
- **Deletion**: Member disappears from both lists
- **Updates**: Profile changes reflect immediately

### 📱 **Multi-Tab Support**

- Changes sync across all open browser tabs
- Consistent state maintained everywhere
- No need for manual refresh

## Performance Considerations

### ⚡ **Efficient Subscriptions**

- **Filtered Subscriptions**: Only listen to relevant organization data
- **Specific Events**: Target specific event types where possible
- **Cleanup Handling**: Proper channel cleanup on unmount
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks with proper unsubscription

### 🎯 **Optimized Updates**

- **State Updates**: Minimal re-renders using React state updates
- **Data Parsing**: Parse department IDs only when needed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on subscription errors

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ **Basic Functionality**

1. **Admin deactivates member** → Member auto-signed out
2. **Admin reactivates member** → Member can sign back in
3. **Admin updates member role** → Changes reflect immediately
4. **Admin permanently deletes member** → Member removed from all lists

### 🔄 **Edge Cases**

1. **Network interruption** → Subscription reconnects automatically
2. **Multiple admins** → All changes sync across admin sessions
3. **Browser tab switching** → State maintained across tabs
4. **Member self-update** → Changes reflect in admin view

### 🐛 **Error Handling**

1. **Subscription failure** → Fallback to periodic refresh
2. **Invalid payload** → Error logging without crash
3. **Auth token expiry** → Graceful subscription cleanup

## Security Features

### 🔐 **Tenant Isolation**

- Organization-specific subscriptions
- No cross-tenant data leakage
- Proper filtering at database level

### 🛡️ **Permission Checks**

- Role-based subscription access
- Admin-only channels for sensitive operations
- User-specific filtering for personal status

## Monitoring & Debugging

### 📊 **Console Logging**

Comprehensive logging for debugging:

```typescript
console.log("Members table change detected:", payload);
console.log("Deactivated members tab change detected:", payload);
console.log("Member status change for user:", authUserId, payload);
```

### 🔍 **Channel Names**

Unique channel names for easy debugging:

- `member-status-monitor` - Personal status monitoring
- `members-realtime` - Organization member list
- `deactivated-members-realtime` - Deactivated members section
- `deactivated-members-realtime-tab` - Deactivated members tab
