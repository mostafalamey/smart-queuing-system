## Quick Fix for Browser Caching Issues

When you restart the dev server and get stuck on the loading page, try these solutions in order:

### Method 1: Use Clean Development Command

```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

### Method 2: Manual Cache Clear

1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete the `.next` folder:

   ```bash
   rmdir /s /q .next
   ```

3. Restart the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Method 3: Browser Solutions

1. **Hard Refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Open Developer Tools**: `F12`
3. **Right-click refresh button** → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. **Private/Incognito mode**: `Ctrl + Shift + N`

### Method 4: Use Different Browser

- Try Chrome, Firefox, or another browser
- Each browser has separate cache

### Method 5: Development Tips

1. Keep browser Developer Tools open (`F12`)
2. In Network tab, check "Disable cache"
3. This prevents caching during development

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems

**Symptoms**: Stuck on login page, redirect loops

**Solutions**:

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check Supabase environment variables
- Restart development server

### Real-time Updates Not Working

**Symptoms**: Dashboard not updating when customers join

**Solutions**:

- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify Supabase real-time is enabled
- Check network connectivity
- Refresh the page to re-establish connections

### Component Export Errors

**Symptoms**: "default export is not a React Component"

**Solutions**:

- Check for proper export syntax: `export default function ComponentName()`
- Ensure no duplicate exports in the same file
- Verify component function is properly closed
- Check for syntax errors in the component

## Why Caching Issues Happen

- Next.js generates unique chunk IDs for JavaScript files
- When you restart the server, old chunk IDs become invalid
- Browser tries to load cached (invalid) chunks
- Modern browsers should handle this better, but Edge sometimes struggles

## Long-term Solution

Consider using Chrome or Firefox for development as they handle chunk invalidation better than Edge.
