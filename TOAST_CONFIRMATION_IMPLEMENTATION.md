```

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

## 📱 How It Works Now

### **Sign Out Flow**

1. User clicks "Sign Out" from profile dropdown
2. Confirmation modal appears: "Are you sure you want to sign out?"
3. User can confirm or cancel
4. If confirmed, redirects to login page

### **Delete Actions (Branches/Departments)**

1. User clicks delete action
2. Confirmation modal appears with specific item name
3. Clear warning about consequences (e.g., "will delete all departments")
4. User must explicitly confirm dangerous action
5. Success/error feedback via toast system

### **Reset Queue Flow**

1. User clicks "Reset Queue" button
2. Custom modal appears with two clear options side-by-side:
   - "Reset Queue Only" - Quick reset
   - "Reset + Cleanup Database" - Reset with optimization
3. User selects their preferred option
4. Modal closes and action executes
5. Success/error feedback via toast system

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Clear messaging** - Each confirmation explains exactly what will happen
- **Proper confirmation for destructive actions** - Delete and reset operations require explicit confirmation
- **Contextual information** - Modals show specific item names and consequences
